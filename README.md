I have been invited to serve as a reviewer (and program committee member) for AISTATS 2026. AISTATS (International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics) is a leading conference in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and statistics, particularly well-regarded in North America and Europe. It is renowned for its integration of theory and practice, covering topics ranging from probabilistic models and Bayesian methods to deep learning and large-scale data analysis. The acceptance rate is approximately 30%. The deadline for abstract submissions is September 25, 2025. Submissions are welcome.

I received an invitation to review for ICLR 2026. Thank you to the program chairs. ICLR, short for the International Conference on Learning Representations, is one of the top academic conferences in the field of artificial intelligence, focusing particularly on deep learning, representation learning, and their applications. ICLR was founded in 2013 by Turing Award winners Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun. Along with NeurIPS and ICML, ICLR is considered one of the three top machine learning conferences. The abstract submission deadline has now passed, and the estimated submissions are 25k+. The results will likely be released after January 8, 2026. Good luck to everyone.
